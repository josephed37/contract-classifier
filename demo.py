"""
Streamlit Web Application for Contract Classification with OCR.

This script creates a user-friendly web interface for the contract
classification API, now with added OCR capabilities for scanned documents.

Features:
- Handles both text-based and image-based (scanned) PDFs.
- First attempts direct text extraction with PyMuPDF for speed.
- If direct extraction yields little text, it falls back to Tesseract OCR.
- Sends the extracted text to the backend FastAPI for classification.
- Displays the predicted category and confidence score.

To run this application:
1. Ensure the Tesseract OCR engine is installed on your system.
2. Make sure the FastAPI server is running (`uvicorn src.main:app`).
3. In a new terminal, run: `streamlit run demo.py`
