"""
Advanced Synthetic Contract Document Generation Script (Hard Version).

This script creates a more realistic and challenging dataset for the
contract classification project. It introduces several real-world complexities:

1.  **Class Imbalance:** The number of documents per category is uneven,
    simulating a real-world scenario where some contract types are
    far more common than others.
2.  **Keyword Overlap (Ambiguity):** The script intentionally injects
    keywords from one category into another (e.g., adding NDA-style
    confidentiality clauses to Vendor agreements). This forces models
    to learn context rather than just memorizing keywords.
3.  **Longer Documents:** A much larger pool of boilerplate text is used
    to generate longer documents, testing the models' ability to handle
    more noise and potentially requiring truncation.

To run:
